### Problem 1: Encourage Donation

Sarah owns a Cookie shop. Sarah has a limited number of types of cookies but she has an unlimited supply of each type. In her shop every cookie is associated with a donation amount - which means every time someone buys a cookie she keeps the donation amount associated to that and give to charity. Sarah want to encourage people to buy those cookies which will make her donate more money. 

###### Rules:

- No limit on maximum amount that a person can use.
- Each cookie has a name, price and donation amount. 
- Name should be less than 20 characters
- Price and Donation amount should be > 0
- Result should display maximum donation amount Sarah can hold with thecombination of cookies.

##### Sample Input:

Total Money: $20

| Name | Price | Table |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| A    | 5     | 2     |
| B    | 3     | 1     |
| C    | 7     | 4     |
| D    | 9     | 3     |
| E    | 1     | 0     |

##### Sample Output:

10 (7,7,5,1)

### Probelm 2: Cash Back Application

- At the end of given time 
  - Display top product (only one) with name and price.
  - Display name of other people bought same device along with eligible cash back amount (different between their purchase and lowest price).
  - Do not display if the difference is 0.
